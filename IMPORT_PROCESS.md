# Project Import Process

## Overview
The import scripts are used **only once** to populate the baseline data. After that, projects are managed through the Wagtail admin interface as snippets.

## One-Time Setup Process

### 1. Import Stock Projects
```bash
# Import projects as Project snippets
python manage.py import_stock_projects_simple
```

### 2. Set Stock Logo
```bash
# Set a stock company logo
python manage.py set_stock_logo
```

### 3. Create Baseline
```bash
# Create baseline.sql with all the imported data
python manage.py postgres_backup --baseline --include-media
```

## After Import
- Projects are managed through **Wagtail Admin > Snippets > Projekter**
- No need to run import scripts again
- Add/edit/delete projects directly in the admin interface
- Images are automatically handled by Wagtail

## Media Structure
- **Original images**: `baselineData/media/original_images/` (7 clean files)
- **Rendered images**: `baselineData/media/images/` (auto-generated by Wagtail)
- **No duplicates**: Clean structure with only original files

## Notes
- Import scripts are for initial setup only
- All project management happens in Wagtail admin
- Media files are automatically optimized by Wagtail
- Baseline.sql contains the complete database state for deployment
