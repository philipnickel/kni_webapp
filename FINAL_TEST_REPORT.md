## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. Johann's Tenant Admin (johann.localhost:8001/admin/)
**Status: ❌ WAGTAIL TABLE ISSUES**

**Error**: `relation "wagtailusers_userprofile" does not exist`

**Root Cause**: This is the fundamental Wagtail + django-tenants incompatibility we discussed earlier. While we successfully faked migrations to avoid initial conflicts, some Wagtail tables are still missing in the tenant schema.

**Impact**: 
- Super Admin interface works perfectly (✅)
- Johann's Wagtail admin interface cannot load (❌)
- Core tenant data management works (✅)
- Theme system works perfectly (✅)

**Workaround Options**:
1. **Minimal CMS**: Create a simple Django admin interface for Johann's content (instead of full Wagtail)
2. **Manual Table Creation**: Manually create the missing Wagtail tables
3. **Alternative CMS**: Use a different CMS that's more compatible with django-tenants

### 2. Domain Setup
**Status: ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL SETUP**

**Issue**: `johann.localhost` requires manual /etc/hosts entry
**Solution**: Add this line to `/etc/hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1 johann.localhost
```
